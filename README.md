Scrapbook
=========

With Scrapbook, you can easily add and remove tasks from your list. See a movie in your Wal-Mart? Scrap that! When you arrive at home, you'll get a notification with your taken picture and you can just tap to remove.

Scrapbook is designed by James Brooks, CoreData backend made by Max Kramer in the context of the Thinkspace Pioneers Hackathon in London on 25-01-14.
